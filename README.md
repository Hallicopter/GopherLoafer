### Two (wip, end goal pointillism.)

Generates a palette using kmeans, and does some sloppy colour distance measurement for generating "art". Lots of improvements can be made, such as generating good results.

Also, added a new GIF generation feature due to popular demand. Also, my eyes weren't hurting enough yet so.
Note the colour palette seems to have changed. Some weird gif quirk. Will try to fix, looks dead.
